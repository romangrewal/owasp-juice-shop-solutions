## Missing Encoding
### Challenge: Retrieve the photo of Bjoern's cat in "melee combat-mode".

* Visit the Photo Wall
* Inspect src to find the broken image
* Right click on the image src to visit in new tab
* Observe that image does not render because of '#' encoding
* Encode '#' to '%23' in the URl to render the image onto the screen
